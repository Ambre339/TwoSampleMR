\usage{
mv_multiple(
  mvdat,
  intercept = FALSE,
  instrument_specific = FALSE,
  pval_threshold = 5e-08,
  plots = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mvdat}{Output from \code{\link{mv_harmonise_data}}.}

\item{intercept}{Should the intercept by estimated (\code{TRUE}) or force line through the origin (\code{FALSE}, default).}

\item{instrument_specific}{Should the estimate for each exposure be obtained by using all instruments from all exposures (\code{FALSE}, default) or by using only the instruments specific to each exposure (\code{TRUE}).}

\item{pval_threshold}{P-value threshold to include instruments. The default is \code{5e-8}.}

\item{plots}{Create plots? The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\description{
Performs modified multivariable MR analysis. For each exposure the instruments are selected then all exposures for those SNPs are regressed against the outcome together, weighting for the inverse variance of the outcome.
