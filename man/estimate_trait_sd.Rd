\title{Estimate trait SD by obtaining beta estimates from z-scores and finding the ratio with original beta values}
\usage{
estimate_trait_sd(b, se, n, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{b}{vector of effect sizes.}

\item{se}{vector of standard errors.}

\item{n}{vector of sample sizes.}

\item{p}{vector of allele frequencies.}
}
\value{
Vector of sd estimates for each association.
}
\description{
Assumes that sample size and allele frequency is correct for each SNP, and that allele frequency gives a reasonable estimate of the variance of the SNP.
