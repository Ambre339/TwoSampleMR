\usage{
mv_ivw(mvdat, pval_threshold = 5e-08)
}
\arguments{
\item{mvdat}{Output from \code{\link{mv_harmonise_data}}.}

\item{pval_threshold}{P-value threshold to include instruments. The default is \code{5e-8}.}

\description{
Performs modified multivariable MR analysis. For each exposure the instruments are selected then all exposures for those SNPs are regressed against the outcome together, weighting for the inverse variance of the outcome.
